<h2>An Overview of traffic across Janet</h2>
<p name="acts">
This first file demonstrates the overall traffic from the Janet network from 2006 to 2016 using white noise.<br/>
The file begins with the sound of a 56k modem before displaying the data using white noise.</p>

</div>
<p>Contextual version of the overall traffic data with a timeline that is voiced over.<br />
The percussion beat represents the same data as the white noise. It is set as background to the <br />
voico over, which provides contextual information for the timeline.</p>
<p>This audio info-graphic explores the use of context to change the audience focus.</p>

<h2>Regional Research Traffic</h2>
<p name="dual">
The second file interleaves instruments to show the relations in research traffic across the four regions.<br />
This sonification is a quartet comprised of England as a flute, Scotland as a clarinet, Wales as an organ and <br />
  Northern Ireland as percussion.<br />
 The English and Scottish data are close to each other. The Welsh data changes from being very quiet to being a <br />
  peak. The Northern Irish data is so quiet that is represented as a percussive beat.<br />

The keyboard typing samples are controlled by the data. The more data there is, the faster the keypress.<br />
